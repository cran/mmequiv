The goal of `mmequiv` is to provide users the ability to calculate
standardized Morphine Milligram Equivalent (MME) doses for prescription
opioid medications for research purposes.

`mmequiv`â€™s API wrapper functions takes information about prescription
opioids used by study participants and directly interfaces with the [NIH
HEAL MME Online Calculator](https://research-mme.wakehealth.edu/) API
from R to calculate MME and daily MME based on several standardized
definitions. Because the NIH HEAL MME Online Calculator API has a rate
limit of 50 requests per 15 minutes, `mmequiv` also provides functions
that perform the same calculations locally without needing to call the
API when the user has large data sets (or when the user may not have
access to the internet).

`mmequiv` is intended for the same purposes as the NIH HEAL MME Online
Calculator - as a data resource for: research, analytical purposes using
claims or dispensing data, and surveillance of population-level
medication utilization.

**Important**: Users should be aware of the caveats and limitations of
the NIH HEAL MME Online Calculator - these also apply to `mmequiv`:

> The data collection tool is *NOT* intended for any clinical
> decision-making by clinicians while prescribing opioids. The MME
> conversion factors in this survey *DO NOT* constitute any clinical
> guidance for prescribing or recommendations for converting patients
> from one form of opioid analgesic to another.

al*. (2025)](https://www.doi.org/10.1097/j.pain.0000000000003529).
