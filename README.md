The goal of `mmequiv` is to provide users the ability to calculate
standardized Morphine Milligram Equivalent (MME) doses for prescription
opioid medications for research purposes.

`mmequiv` uses information about prescription opioids used by study
participants to calculate MME and daily MME based on several
standardized definitions, including directly interfacing with the NIH
HEAL MME Online Calculator[^1] API from R. Because the NIH HEAL MME
Online Calculator API has a rate limit of 50 (patient-level) requests
per 15 minutes, `mmequiv` can also perform the same calculations locally
without needing to call the API when working with larger data or when
internet access is unavailable.

`mmequiv` is intended for the same purposes as the NIH HEAL MME Online
Calculator - as a data resource for: research, analytical purposes using
claims or dispensing data, and surveillance of population-level
medication utilization.

**Important**: Users should be aware of the caveats and limitations of
the NIH HEAL MME Online Calculator - these also apply to `mmequiv`:

> The data collection tool is ***NOT*** intended for any clinical
> decision-making by clinicians while prescribing opioids. The MME
> conversion factors in this survey ***DO NOT*** constitute any clinical
> guidance for prescribing or recommendations for converting patients
> from one form of opioid analgesic to another.

Much of the information in the `mmequiv` documentation is pulled
directly from either the NIH HEAL MME Online Calculator website or the
paper from the calculatorâ€™s creators.[^2] I recommend reviewing these
resources for any details not covered by the package documentation.

## Installation

You can install `mmequiv` from CRAN using the following code:

``` r
install.packages("mmequiv")
```

You can install the development version of `mmequiv` like so:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github('KennethATaylor/mmequiv')
```

## Citation

In addition to citing the original paper by Adams, *et al*.,[^3]
consider citing this package. You can obtain information needed to cite
the package by running:

``` r
citation("mmequiv")
```
